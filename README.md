# The "Free" in Agentic AI Coding: A Ranked Comparison of Pro-Grade LLM Access

## Intro

This document compares free tiers for agentic AI coding tools, **focusing on access to pro-grade LLMs (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3)**. While "free" means no monetary cost, this guide highlights the nuances of what's available, including details on vendor limits, estimated coding hours, and model flexibility. The list is for informational purposes, with community contributions encouraged for accuracy, and is ranked from most to least generous.

## 1. Local models (completely free)

Running open-weight frontier models locally provides unlimited coding assistance without API costs or usage limits. The best tools for local deployment include **[Cline](https://cline.bot/)** (VS Code extension with Plan/Act modes and MCP support), **[Aider](https://aider.chat/)** (command-line assistant with built-in Git integration), and **[Continue](https://www.continue.dev/)** (open-source VS Code extension supporting 200+ models). All work seamlessly with **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** to run frontier models like Devstral (24B parameters, optimized for agentic coding), Qwen3-Coder, DeepSeek Coder V2, Codestral, and GLM-4.5.

**Note**: Frontier models require GPUs with substantial RAM/VRAM. See Simon Willison's article on [running GLM-4.5 AIR on his laptop to build Space Invaders](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/29/space-invaders/) for a practical example.

## Methodology / Assumptions

- **Goal**: Compare agentic coding systems by their access to frontier models.
- **[1] Requests to hours**: 60 requests â‰ˆ 1 AI-assisted coding hour (based on real-world task simulation).
- **[2] Tokens to hours**: ~10k tokens â‰ˆ 1 coding hour (when vendors publish tokens, not requests).
- **[3] Chats/Credits to hours**: Multi-turn agentic chats and prompt credits are assumed equivalent to single requests for estimation purposes.
- If you spot an error or missing source link, please open an issue or a pull request.
