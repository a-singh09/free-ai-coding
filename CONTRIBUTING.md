# Contributing to Free AI Coding

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We welcome contributions that help keep this resource accurate and comprehensive.

## How to Contribute

### Adding New AI Coding Tools

When submitting a new tool, please include:

1. **Tool name and website link**
2. **Pro-grade models offered** (must achieve ≥60% on SWE-bench Verified)
3. **Free tier limits** with official documentation links
4. **Estimated free coding time** (we'll calculate this using our methodology)
5. **Credit card requirement** (yes/no)
6. **Source links** for all claims

### Updating Existing Tools

For updates to existing tools, provide:

1. **What changed** (new model, updated limits, pricing changes, etc.)
2. **Official source links** documenting the changes
3. **Date when the change took effect**

### Reporting Inaccuracies

If you spot an error:

1. **Specify which tool** and what information is incorrect
2. **Provide the correct information** with official source links
3. **Include when you verified** this information

## Submission Format

### For New Tools (Issues)
```
Tool: [Tool Name]
Website: [Official URL]
Models: [List of pro-grade models with SWE-bench scores]
Free Tier: [Specific limits]
Source: [Official documentation URL]
Credit Card Required: [Yes/No]
Additional Notes: [Any relevant details]
```

### For Pull Requests

1. **Keep changes focused** - one tool per PR when possible
2. **Follow existing format** - match the structure and style of existing entries
3. **Update the ranking** - place tools in the correct order by free tier generosity
4. **Include sources** - add links to official documentation
5. **Update the table** - ensure the summary table reflects your changes
6. **Test your changes** - verify all links work and formatting is correct

## Guidelines

- **Verify information** - Only include tools you've personally tested or have official documentation for
- **Stay current** - Limits and models change frequently, so recent verification is important  
- **Be neutral** - Avoid promotional language, stick to factual comparisons
- **Include context** - Note any important limitations or requirements
- **Respect categories** - Place tools in the appropriate section based on their offerings

## What We're Looking For

Priority contributions:
- New tools offering free access to pro-grade models (≥60% SWE-bench Verified)
- Updates to existing tool limits or model offerings
- Corrections to inaccurate information with proper sources
- Translation updates for international README files

## Questions?

Open an issue if you're unsure about:
- Whether a tool qualifies as "pro-grade"
- How to calculate estimated coding time  
- Which section to place a new tool in
- Formatting or style questions
